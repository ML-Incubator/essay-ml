I think phone policy at school should not let students use their phone during class or free time. For several reasons. First, school has to be an area of education and not of free time. Because in my point of view its a distraction to your self and the people around you. Second, phones could get stolen by the people you don't get along with. Also, another reason for school policy to know is that it can cause drama between friends and also people you don't know. Finally , phones can cause cheating, cheating is what school doesn't want so that's one of my main reasons why i don't want phones being used in school hours,",8,Cell phones at school,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5

In my opinion, I think that you should allow students to bring their phones to school, but with the condition, to use them outside their classes. Students need their phones for any emergencies. However, students are to understand that teachers don't want them to be disturbing the class. Also, I think that the students know better to turn off their phones, if they don't want their phones to be taken away. Students still bring their phones to school whether you teachers and principal don't allowed them to. So, I absolutely agree with the policy of letting students bring their phones",8,Cell phones at school,3.0,2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5

Dear principal students should have phones at school because there can be an emergence. Policy 1 said that students can use there cell phones only free time and lunch and it's a good idea because if students didn't have phones it will be bad because there family wouldn't be able to reach them if there was a problem. If the students fell sick they can call there parents and go home because some teacher don't let the students go to the nurse if they fell bad. The students should turn off there phones when there in the class but they don't because the stuff that there learning is so boring and they don't want to do everything so they text there friends so the teacher should make",8,Cell phones at school,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0

i think phones should be allowed in school because if you forgot like a book or something you could call your parents to go get it so you don't get in trouble in class or if your like sick you can call your parents or guardian to bring your medicine because you can't get your medicine in school or if your lost in like a field trip you can call your parents to pick you up and without a phone you'll be lost or get in trouble or and that's why phones in school but i think it should be turned off during class other then that you won't get lose or get busted for not having any supplies but with a phone you won't get lost or miss anything you need for school and that's why i think phones should be allowed in school. and nothing will happen to you but if you have a phone I think you'll good or maybe even if you have tutoring and your mom doesn't show up or forgot you can call her and that's why i think phones should be allowed in school.",8,Cell phones at school,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5
3AB3FC197550,"Do you really think students need cell phones during school hour. While school hours u need to learn not being on the phone the whole day.

you need to pay close attention to the teacher instead of being on the phone texting or calling someone. I don't think u need a cell phone I would just say for emergencies. Imagine being on the cell phone the whole school hours and never paying attention that just is going to make you not graduate from school just because you never payed attention because a phone. I wouldn't risk my future cause just of a phone

There's so many reasons why they shouldn't allowed cellophane's and here are some' s. first of all their very distracting. let's see while the teachers are explaining something to you and your somewhere texting or calling what are you learning NOTHING!! it's difficult to bring things back and to learn them. Learning new stuff is sometimes difficult imagine trying to learn all the thing that you missed.

Another reason is that when they grow up they aren't going to graduate because they never payed attention at school. And they wouldn't have a good career like they alwayst dreamed",8,Cell phones at school,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

I think that students shouldn't be able to have cell phones at school at all because first its to distracting and the student wont be learning anything because he/she would be occupied doing something there not supposed to be doing. Second is school is a leaning environment not a place to be doing other things with your cell phone we come to school to learn! The third why i think having cell phones on campus is because we all have ore free time to do whatever we have to do.

The first reason why i think havening cell phones on school campus is because its really distracting and we wont learn anything because well be occupied on our cell phones. For example , we need to forces on more important things such as school work and maybe after school activates. I think we shouldn't be able to have our phones because 50% of students that have cell phones fail there classes because while the teacher is explaining something important the student us either messing around or texting another student which is not only affecting he/she but others around them.

The second reason why i think cell phones shouldn't be allowed on school campus is because school is a place to learn not use your phone in class. We come to school for one reason and one reason only at that is to go to school and get the education we need for a better future and all of the above. We need to help all students get ahead of life and have good jobs that they could all be proud of.

The third reason why i think having cell phones at school is a bad idea is because we all have free time i do understand we also have to have a social life and communicate with other students or peers. Not everything is fun and games sometimes we just need to expect the what our parents do what they do because they love and care about us.

We shouldn't be able to have cell phones because honestly its just a waste of time and we could do so much better and if we do a good job in school than we would have time for other things because in life there is time for everything but it also has its own time. we shoulnt be abl",8,Cell phones at school,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0

I believe that students should have cell phones in campus. If they have something they always wanted from a school. They'll be wanting to learn more. If there's a emergency somewhere where they cant get to the office immediately , they could use there cell phones to call other students to tell the teachers that there's an emergency. Parents won't be angry about this policy because they'll know that there children are learning in ways that they'll want to learn.

So, if they know that they can use there cell phones in school they wont be using it during class hours. Cell phones are really use full to students during school hours. It keeps them safe and will help there education in how they will want to learn. You should really reconsider to allow students to bring there cell phones to school. It will be helpful to them. Students will think that education is fun now. And If you really look at it there's not much time of break or free time. The only time they'll use their phones a lot is during lunch time.

Take my opinion and try it . You'll see that i was right. Our school will be fun for students our age. Parents might want to bring there younger children to this school when they get older.",8,Cell phones at school,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5

280F4A13DE2B,"I think the principle should go with option of letting us use are phones during lunch and the other school brake times instead of the option of not having phones at school at all. Many of the students have there own cell phone and some students might need it for different occasion's to communicate with are family, parents, or guardian. An example would be me i needed my phone to contact my parents during are lock down that happened not to long ago, i sent them a message from my phone to tell them ""mom we are on lock down so i cant leave the school i don't know what time we will be out ill call or message you when its ok for us to leave"" that really helped me to communicate with my parents and if the principle went with the option of not having phones at school there probably wouldn't have been any way to have told my parents we were on lock down. I think going with the option of using phones during lunch is a good idea, it might even stop students from using there phones during class when there not suppose to, knowing as soon as there done with class and they leave they have time to communicate with friends or family. It can help students grades and can stop students from not paying attention to the lesson or teacher while they use there phones.

The big idea about this is trust the students can not use their phone when ever if the students don't follow the rules you can stop phone use but, give it a try and see how well it works out for you but, make you do the right choice or have a vote for the whole school that's how it all work in the U.S. do what's best for your school.",8,Cell phones at school,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5

Dear: TEACHER_NAME

how are you? i just took some time to write you this letter you need to know about.

I am writing you a letter to describe to you i think the better policy, policy 2 one reason is because, phones are not allowed in the school in the first place, phones are a disturbing materials for class and its better to not have phones in school at all. Even though school allows them to have phones students will still turn them on and use them during class. Also some students use phone during reading time when they are in the library when supposable the teacher is teaching them and behind her back many kids are texting with their phones . Another occasions kids usually need to be doing their work but they are instead texting. i believe policy 2 is better for the school not to allow students have phones at school at all. if you have any questions please contact me as soon as you can at PHONE_NUMBER

I think that you should allowed the students of your school to use there cell phones when they have the time to. The students should have in mind that when the teacher ask them to put it always that they well. But also to remember that they have the right to use them. Will this is why I think that allowing the students to have there phones with them is ok. One because they want to time in school to call friends that may not be in the same school or if they have an important thing to do after school in they can't go. Another is if they need help with something and on one is with them . Now I what you might be saying that the students are never going to leave their phones not even if there in class. will there can be a punishment to that person that dose not flow the rules. You can assigned any thing to that person like after school clean up or Saturday school something like that so that they know not to do it again and that they need to lessen to the teacher when they are ask to well that is all i have to say principal.

Dear TEACHER_NAME;

why should cell phones not be used? I strongly agree cell phones should be use at any time. They might have personal problems and need their phones out. They might also have a personal problem or need to fly out of the state right away because of personal problems.

To begin with, what if the students are in science or math class and need the calculator for them to work out a problem, what if they have personal problems and need to have their phone on or there just in case. I think students should also be able to use any other electronics on their free time.

Let me explain further, students should be able to use cell phones in case of emergencies only, not to talk on the phone with other students",8,Cell phones at school,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0

I think that you should allows students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times. This would be really fun to do so that the students can text their friends and wont be using their cell phones during class. If you let us do this we will make sure we have our phones off for class. some students would think this is a really good idea to because a lot of students love to text during school and since we are not allow to have cell phones during school hours students still text anyways and if you let us use our cell phones during lunch period or any other free times then students wouldn't have to worry about texting in class and getting their cell phones taken away. when the students text at school and get caught the teacher takes their phones away.

If you let us use our cell phones during lunch time you wouldn't have to worry about taking the cell phones away or anything. I believe this is a good policy because if u don't allow students to use their phones some students don't care and will use it anyways and that's why they get caught and their phones get taken away and then their parents have to come get it and its just a lot of mess.

If you think this policy is good then you would use it. I know a lot of other students would really like this policy to not just me but everyone else.

A lot of students love to text in school and they pay more attention to their phones then learning in class. And if u let us use this policy i think that more students would pay more attention in class since their phones would be turned off. If you don't think is a good policy then their are a lot of other ones.

I'm writing this letter to you because i think that is better to not allow students to have cell phones at school at all because they might get distract when they have their cell phones and they might use them during class. I think this is better because some students bring cell phones to school and they use them during class and they don't pay attention to the teacher and they are always distract when they have cell phones, some students don't pay attention because they are using cell phones in class and when the teacher ask them a question they don't know what to answer because they didn't pay attention when the teacher was talking. Another thing is that some students are now getting in trouble because they are using cell phones talking to other people that they don't really know and they give that person information about them and about school and they don't really know who that person is and they could be in danger because that person knows everything about them and about the school.

Sometimes students have their cell phones turn on during class and when the teacher is talking the phone begins to sound like someone calling or a message and they interrupted the teacher and the teacher have to take time from the lesson and tell the student to turn on the cell phone or to give it to her.

You should allow students to brings cell phones to school because you never know what could happened to them. Because something could happened to them or to someone else after school and there's no way to contact for help. And so like if there ride ain't coming after school they could call them to let them know.
